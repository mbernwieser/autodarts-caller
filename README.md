# autodarts-caller

Let someone call your score in your [autodarts.io](https://github.com/autodarts/docs)-setup. 

## Installation

### Install docker and autodarts-caller
1. Log-in to your raspberry pi via ssh
1. Go to your home-directory: `cd ~`
1. Install `docker` (we use docker to easily start a webserver on which we run the caller-app):
    - `curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh`
1. Check if installation was successful by running a hello-world image: 
    - `sudo docker run --rm armhf/hello-world`
    - If you see no errors everything should be fine
1. Download and unzip `autodarts-caller`:
    1. `wget https://github.com/mbernwieser/autodarts-caller/releases/download/1.0.0/autodarts-caller.zip`
    1. `unzip -o autodarts-caller.zip -d .`
1. Go to the `autodarts-caller`-directory you just created:
    - `cd autodarts-caller/`
1. Make installation-script executable: 
    - `chmod +x install_and_run_autodarts_caller.sh`

### Add caller sounds 
1. Sound files have to be added to `autodarts-caller/sounds/`
1. Either you create sounds by yourself or you use existing soundpacks (e.g. sounds from Russ Bray)
    - Due to copyright issues the sounds are not included in this repository but you can find them in various dart-communities
    - Example (Russ Bray): https://www.dartn-forum.de/thread/129-russ-bray-sounds-f%C3%BCr-dartpro-software/?postID=473437#post473437
    - Darts Gondel (German sounds for 2â‚¬): https://www.dartzentrum-augsburg.de/produkt/darts-gondel-01-caller-sound-dateien 
1. Requirement: all sound files must be in .mp3 format
    - if the sounds are in a different format they have to be converted to .mp3 first
1. Possible sounds:
    - 1.mp3 - 180.mp3
    - 0.mp3 ("no score")
    - gameon.mp3 ("gameon" on succesful connect & additional sound buttons)
1. An easy way to add the sounds is to use a programm like `FileZilla`:
    1. Download and install `FileZilla` on the system from where you connect to the raspberry-pi
    1. Open `FileZilla` and connect to your raspberry-pi with the following parameters:
        1. `Server`: `<ip-address-of-your-raspberry-pi>`
        1. `Username`: `<your-raspberry-pi-username>` (default = "pi")
        1. `Password`: `<your-raspberry-pi-password>` 
        1. `Port`: `22`
    1. Now you should be able to just drag and drop the sounds from your system to the raspberry-pi
        - File structure should look like:
        - `autodarts-caller/sounds/0.mp3`
        - `autodarts-caller/sounds/1.mp3`
        - `autodarts-caller/sounds/2.mp3`
        - `...`

## Running
1. Start `autodarts` (if not already running):
    - `autodarts`
1. Run `autodarts-caller` install-script (maybe in a second terminal window/tab):
    - `./install_and_run_autodarts_caller.sh`
    - if everything's working you should see some log-output but no errors
1. **After the first successful run you can start/stop the autodarts-caller with:**
    - `sudo docker start autodarts-caller`
    - `sudo docker stop autodarts-caller`
1. Open a browser and go to: `<ip-of-your-raspberry-pi>:8080`
    - you can copy the ip-address from the board-manager url
    - e.g. `192.168.178.73:8080`
1. Now you should see the Autodarts-Caller web-ui (see screenshot below)
1. In the `Autodarts-IP:`-field you should enter the IP where autodarts is running (propably the same `<ip-of-your-raspberry-pi>`)
    - Enter the IP without `http` or `/`
    - you can copy the ip-address from the board-manager url
    - e.g. `192.168.178.73`
1. Click on `Connect`
1. Throw three darts and if everything works you should hear your score

## Drawbacks

**Important:** This tool has no access to the information of your current match. It can only call the score of your thrown three darts. Neither does it now if you've just won a leg, nor does it call the remaining points.

Besides that: the autodarts-api is not stable yet and can change anytime. This means that this tool may stop working after a new release of autodarts.

## Updating

## Extending with plugins

You can write your own plugins in JavaScript to extend the functionality of this tool. Maybe you want to play your favorite song if you score yet another S1 | S1 | S1 or activate some LEDs if you finally make the 180.

To do that you just have to:
1. Copy the plugin-template `plugins/template.js` to `plugins/your-custom-plugin.js`
1. Import your plugin in `index.html`
1. Add your custom logic in `plugins/your-custom-plugin.js`
1. ... if you've created a cool plugin, don't forget to share it with the Autodarts-Community

### Adding logic to your plugins

All information about the throw can be found in the throw-event, just take a look at the information via `console.log(event)`. From here you can do whatever you want:
- call other APIs (e.g. some LED system) with a simple fetch-call [JS-Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)
- you can call the built-in sound-service
    - `event.soundService.playAudio(filename, duration = null);`
- you can call the built-in notification-service
    - `event.notificationService.success(message, options = {});`
    - [all functions and options](https://ember-cli-notifications.netlify.app/)

## Contributing

This simple web-app is built with Ember.js. The main-logic (= handling of websocket messages) is done in `app/services/websocket.js`. For development details see: [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Customizing (quick quide)

- See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for development requirements
- Clone project
- Update files in `app/`
- Build project: `ember build --environment=production`
- Created folder `autodarts-caller/` can be transfered to raspberry-pi 
- Then follow installation guide starting from: "Download and unzip..." (Replace zip-file with your built folder)
